# Emotion-recognition-using CNN and Tensorflow
This project aims to develop a CNN model to accurately recognize emotions from facial expressions, achieving high accuracy in classifying emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, disgust, and fear. This project aims to enable applications in human-computer interaction, sentiment analysis, and affective computing

Dataset description

                    The dataset was taken from Kaggle. The data consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. The faces have been automatically registered so that the face is more or less centred and occupies about the same amount of space in each image.
The task is to categorize each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression into one of seven categories (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral). The training set consists of 28,709 examples and the public test set consists of 3,589 examples.
